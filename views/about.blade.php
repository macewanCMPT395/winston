<center><h2><u> About this site</u> </h2>
<p>I am in CMPT395 and learning about software engineering. The course is really interesting and is challenging.
This site uses Laravel, PHP, and Sqlite to create a browsable site that also tries to integrate RESTful functions.
So far I have got user creation, user authentication, validation and somewhat user detail editing functions in.
I did have problems with form modelling which would have helped a lot with the editing portion. --Winston
